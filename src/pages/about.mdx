ShortestPathLab develops algorithms for single and multi-agent pathfinding. We study these problems using the tools of AI Planning and Heuristic Search and we consider their application in a variety of real-world settings. Some examples of applications which typically motivate our work: pathfinding in video games, routing and trip planning in transportation networks, motion planning and navigation for mobile robots and automated warehouse logistics.
