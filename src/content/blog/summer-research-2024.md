ShortestPathLab is excited to announce that applications for the 2024 Monash Summer Research Scholarships are now open! ðŸŽ‰

If you're passionate about cutting-edge technology and want to dive deep into the world of pathfinding search, this is your chance to get hands-on experience with innovative research projects.

### Application Details

- Opening Date: 12 August 2024
- Closing Date: 30 August 2024, 5 PM AEST

This summer, ShortestPathLab is offering two exciting research projects:

### 1. Posthoc: The Pathfinding Search Visualiser and Debugger

In this project, you'll work on enhancing [Posthoc](/projects/posthoc/), an award-winning tool that helps researchers visualise and debug pathfinding algorithms. Your role will involve implementing new features that will make it easier for researchers to create and use visualisations. This is a fantastic opportunity to contribute to a tool that is crucial for understanding and improving complex algorithms.
