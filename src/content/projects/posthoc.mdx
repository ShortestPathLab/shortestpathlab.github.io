## The framework for understanding search

We present Posthoc, a debugging and visualisation framework
that helps users better understand how search algorithms work. Posthoc
takes as input _search traces_, human-readable output logs produced
by an algorithmic problem solving program. The logs are are used for
subsequent playback, analysis and visualisation.
Our system does not depend on any specific type of
visualisation nor any particular decision-making schema. Being independent,
Posthoc readily complements new and existing solvers: for AI planning,
pathfinding, and heuristic search, and it can be integrated as a complementary
problem-solving tool alongside.
