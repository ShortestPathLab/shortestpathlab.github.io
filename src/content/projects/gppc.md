The Grid-Based Path Planning Competition (GPPCÂ²) is a forum for tracking and disseminating state-of-the-art progress in the area. It is the fourth edition of the competition, with previous competitions in 2012, 2013 and 2014.

The goals of the competition are:

- To identify important topics in Grid-based Path Planning and to establish clear baselines for state-of-the-art performance.
- To promote best practice for experimental evaluation, including suitable metrics, analysis methods and benchmarking techniques.
- To disseminate results to the broader community and track progress over time.
- To promote and grow research in the area of Grid-based Path Planning.
- We invite submissions from established researchers, active practitioners and interested students. Participation in the competition can help to grow confidence in the practical suitability of existing (in-production) methods or in newly proposed algorithmic techniques.
