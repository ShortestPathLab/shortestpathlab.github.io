## Tracking Research Progress

Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) is a combinatorial problem that asks us to compute collision-free paths for teams of cooperative agents. Many works appear on this topic each year, and a large number of substantial advancements and improvements have been reported. Yet measuring overall progress in MAPF is difficult: there are many potential competitors, and the computational burden for comprehensive experimentation is prohibitively large. Moreover, detailed data from past experimentation is usually unavailable.

This online platform introduces a set of methodological and visualisation tools which can help the community establish clear indicators for state-of-the-art MAPF performance and which can facilitate large-scale comparisons between MAPF solvers. Our objectives are to lower the barrier of entry for new researchers and to further promote the study of MAPF.
