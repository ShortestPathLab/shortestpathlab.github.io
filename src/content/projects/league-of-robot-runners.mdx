## The Competition

The League of Robot Runners is a competition series to foster and advance research areas in the area of Multi-Agent Path Finding.
LoRR aims to:

- identify the core challenges for solving MAPF;
- develop suitable benchmark instances;
- evaluate algorithmic performance in the area and;
- track the state-of-the-art.

The competition provides a standardised system to develop, evaluate, and compare algorithmic techniques.
[Submissions](https://github.com/MAPF-Competition/Code-Archive), [solutions and problem instances](https://github.com/MAPF-Competition/Benchmark-Archive) from the competition are open sourced, to lower barriers, promote dissemination and enable further advancements.

## Competition Series

### 2023 Competition

The first round of the competition was held in 202 and received a total of **825 submissions** from **25 teams worldwide**! The competition identifies two main challenges:

- **Turn actions:**
  In MAPF, robots are often modelled as rotationally invariant agents with unit action costs. This model is disconnected from many applications, where turning
  actions can substantially increase achieved execution costs.
- **Online lifelong problem:**
  In MAPF, the problem is one-shot and
  solved entirely offline.
  Yet real applications are _lifelong_ and _online_: agents receive new tasks upon arrival and they must
  be constantly planned and replanned,
  so as to maximise a throughput objective.

For more details about the setup, results, and resources of the 2023 competition, please visit the [2023 Competition Snapshot Site](https://2023.leagueofrobotrunners.org/).

### 2024 Competition

In 2024, the competition will introduce new tracks with path planning and **task assignments** to reflect the challenges faced by real-world applications.
